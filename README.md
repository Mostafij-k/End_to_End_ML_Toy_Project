# 🚀**End-to-End Machine Learning Project for Beginners**

## 📌Project Overview
This is basically designed for beginner who want to develop a clear understanding of the complete machine learning lifecycle. 
In this tutorial, you will learn how to:
  ✅ Prepare and explore data 
  ✅ Train and evaluate a machine learning model
  ✅ Save the trained model for later use
  ✅ Work with a model without using pipelines
  ✅ Build a clean and efficient workflow using scikit-learn pipelines
  ✅ Load a saved model and make predictions on new data
  
## 📂 This tutorial covers:
  ✔ Data loading
  ✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing
  ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  ✔ Feature selection
  ✔ Model training
  ✔ Model evaluation
  ✔ Saving the trained model as a **pickle (`.pkl`) file**
  
 👉 This helps learners understand **why pipelines are needed** 
 
## 🛠Tools
 ✅ Pandas
 ✅ matplotlib
 ✅ numpy
 ✅ Scikit-learn 
 ✅ Pickle
